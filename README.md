shiro-example
=============
This is a *simple* example on how to integrate Vaadin with Apache Shiro. The purpose of this example is *NOT* to show how to do a proper integration between Vaadin and Shiro, but rather, show you how to get started.

Note 1: The used Shiro configurations are just the default configurations provided by Shiro's tutorial. When implementing the integration, make sure you've gone through all configuration details and made sure that your application is properly configured.

Note 2: shiro-login-outside-vaadin-app does *NOT* create a new session id for the user upon login.
